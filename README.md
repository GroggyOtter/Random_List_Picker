# Random_List_Picker

This is a simple script that provides a gui.  
Provide one or more items in the first box.  
Each item should be on its own line.  

Then pick how many items (winners) you want.  

Click the "Randomly select item(s)!" button and the bottom edit box will be populated with the randomly selected items.

Items cannot be picked more than once.  
If you want something to be picked more than once, it must be in the list more than once.

EG: Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie are in the list. 2 items are picked. You will never see any of those names show up twice.  
If Alpha, Bravo, Bravo, and Charlie are used, there is a possibility you will see Bravo twice.
